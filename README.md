# ðŸ¦¾Study LeetCode using C++ & DirectX 2D

## Main goal : Study as playing a gameðŸš€

*cuz my final stage will be programming an awesome game by myself*  

Will try my best to show **visually** how Data Structures and Algorithms works while solving Leet Code Problems.  

```cpp
  do
  {
    Learn();
    Record();
    Use();
  } while( me.status == gameDev );
```

## Branch Structure

01. Main : Master branch that other branches merge in
02. Solution : Solution codes of Leet Code problems
03. Framework : codes for Dx Frameworks  
~  
and so on...

## Commit Rules

```
[ Main Topic] Abstract of changes
detail : list of classes that have any changes
```
*ex) [ Problem No.#### ] working on problem*
